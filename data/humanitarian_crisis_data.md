## Country/Region Data/Information

1. **Afghanistan**  
   In the country billed by the UN as the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, WFP was supporting up to 15 million people each month through much of last year. It can now only provide emergency assistance to 3 million a month. Earthquakes in Herat province in October that left more than 100,000 new people needing aid added to the pressures.

2. **Bangladesh**  
   Monthly WFP rations for more than 900,000 Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar were reduced in June from $10 to $8, having already been cut from $12 in March. The cuts came just weeks after thousands of refugees lost their homes to Cyclone Mocha, which followed a major fire earlier this year.

3. **Haiti**  
   WFP cut the number of people receiving emergency food assistance by 25% in July – meaning 100,000 of the most vulnerable Haitians are now going without support – and warned this number could rise to 700,000 by the year-end. Gang violence, floods, and earthquakes have all exacerbated the worst hunger crisis in Haiti’s history.

25. **Jordan**  
   Due to ongoing funding shortfalls, WFP’s assistance in Jordan has been gradually reduced. Around 410,000 “vulnerable refugees” in camps and host community members receive monthly cash transfers at a “one third reduced” level. In September, the agency said new donations had allowed aid to continue — after warnings of a suspension — but shortfalls are ongoing.
